# AM10 Data Visualisation and Story Telling - Group 8 Project

# Liverpool, you never walk alone!

Thank you for kicking your ball into our corner of the football pitch. If you are like us, you enjoy watching a nice Liverpool match in the pub over pints and fish & chips. But have you ever thought about what data lies behind the game of football? Or why Liverpool is not performing as well in this year's Premier League? Well, we have the answers for you.

## What data did we use for our analysis?

To create a thorough analysis of Liverpool's history and current situation, we have combined several datasets that compliment each other to derive insights about this legendary football club. The data includes:

- Data from the FIFA games (2015 to 2023)
- Actual data from last year's and the current season of the Premier League
- Historical data on transfers (values, dates, players)
- Data on Liverpool financials

## What kind of questions did we address?

We wanted to better understand Liverpool from all angles. However, we followed a step by step approach to draw some key insights about the football club.

- What is the composition of the Premier League? How does Liverpool compare to its biggest rivals in terms of player value?
- Is Liverpool still financially successful? Can they afford new players and which/where from do they buy them?
- Is the roster of Liverpool still as agressive as ever, or perhaps aging slightly?
- How is Liverpool performing this year? What might be causes for the drop in performance?
- Who could Liverpool look at to improve in the future?

We also deployed some k-means clustering to identify the common characteristics and strenghts of different positions. With the help of this, we hope to make some valuable recommendations on which players Liverpool might be able to target for acquisitions to increase their performance.

## Final notes
In case you are interested in finding the answers to the above questions, feel free to look through our code and pptx/pdf file.

ENJOY!
